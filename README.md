# Project_Beta Destiny for Dummies

```
(Currently this application is a build in progress)

I have been personally invested in the world of video games. With that said, one of my best friends have been getting into video games as well. I therefore wanted to create a simple and beautifully designed application personallized for new players in the world of Destiny 2.
